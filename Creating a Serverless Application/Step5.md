At this stage we will be adding  the client side application . The application will be delivered from an s3 bucket using static hosting. 

So we are going to create an s3 bucket, set it as publicly accessible , configure it as a static website and then edit the client application files to post at your specific installation of this serverless application using the address of the API Gateway that was created. 
Then we upload all the files and test that the application functions.
