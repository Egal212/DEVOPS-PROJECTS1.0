Steps to download wordpress on the webserver.
Download wordpress and copy wordpress to var/www/html
````
mkdir wordpress
  cd   wordpress
  sudo wget http://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz
````
Note: This code downloads wordpress into the wordpress dir, extracts and configures it and then copies it into over to /var/www/html
Verify:
````
ls -l
````
To extract the wordpress run:
````
sudo tar xzvf latest.tar.gz
````
AFter extraction we get an extra folder called wordpress.
Use ``ls -l`` to view it.
Run
````
cd wordpress
ls -l
````
Create the wp-config.php file and copy wp-config-sample into it using.
````
sudo cp -R wp-config-sample.php wp-config.php
````
Use ``ls -l`` to view it.
Run ``pwd`` you should be in 
````
wordpress/wordpress
````
Run ``cd..``
``ls``
You should output
``latest.tar.gz  wordpress``
Copy wordpress to /var/www/html
````
sudo cp -R wordpress/ /var/www/html/
cd /var/www/html
ls -l (confirmt the wordpress)
````

RUN;
````
sudo rm -rf wordpress/
sudo rm  -rf lost+fond/
cd ../..
cd
ls
cd wordpress
ls
ls -l wordpress
````

To open the wordpress folder and copy the content
````
sudo cp -R wordpress/. /var/www/html/
sudo ls -l /var/www/html
cd /var/www/html
ls
sudo yum install mysql-server
````
Note: You are downloaidng mysql-server because the weberver will be acting as a client.
Wordpress has its own database and needs a database server to store login details etc. which is what we just downloaded.
